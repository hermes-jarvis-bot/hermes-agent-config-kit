# How It Works - Technical Deep Dive

How each technology in this configuration system actually works, with real examples and measurements.

If you read the [README](README.md) and thought "okay but HOW does this work mechanically?" - this page is for you.

## Rules: Conditional Context Injection

**The problem:** A 582-line CLAUDE.md loaded into every session wastes context on irrelevant instructions. SSH rules during article writing. Formatting rules during debugging.

**The mechanism:** Claude Code's `.claude/rules/` directory contains rule files that are loaded based on file path patterns. Each file has a glob pattern in its name or frontmatter - the rule only enters context when the agent works with matching files.

```
.claude/rules/
  session-handoff.md        # always loaded (no pattern)
  memory-format.md          # always loaded
  research-copies.md        # loaded when research tasks detected
```

**What actually happens at runtime:**
1. Agent receives a task
2. Claude Code checks which rule files match the current working context
3. Only matching rules are injected into the system prompt
4. The rest never consume tokens

**Impact:** 25 rule files. Rules carrying a `paths:` frontmatter are elevated only in their target area; un-scoped rules are always-on — so the always-on set is kept deliberately lean and consolidated (fewer-but-focused files) rather than sprawling, since everything always-on competes for attention on every turn.

---

## Memory: A Wiki-Graph in Flat Files

**The problem:** Each session starts from scratch. The agent does not know your servers, your project decisions, your past mistakes.

**The mechanism:** 78 markdown files with YAML frontmatter, linked by `[[wiki-links]]`. No database. No vector store. Just files that git can version.

```yaml
# Example: reference_gpu_servers.md
---
name: GPU training servers
description: Connection details for cloud GPU instances
type: reference
created: 2026-03-15
---

GPU servers for training and inference.
- gpu-train-01: training, 8x H200
- gpu-infer-01: inference, 4x H200

## Related
- [[docker_production_image]] - container running on these servers
- [[project_lora_training]] - training happens here
```

**How loading works:**

```
MEMORY.md (index file)
  |
  +-- "Always Load" section (27 files)
  |     user_profile, server configs, active rules, feedback
  |
  +-- "On Demand" section (51 files)
        projects, tools, methodology - loaded when topic is relevant
```

The agent reads `MEMORY.md` at session start. The "Always Load" entries are read immediately. The "On Demand" entries are read only when the agent encounters a related topic.

**The graph:** 178 cross-links between 78 files. Hub node: server infrastructure (10 connections). Average connectivity: 2.3 links per file. 81% of files are connected to at least one other file.

**Why not a vector database?** Three reasons:
1. Files are greppable - you can search with `grep`, not just semantic similarity
2. Files are in git - full version history, diffs, blame
3. Files are readable by any agent - no SDK, no setup, no embedding model

---

## Handoffs: Session-to-Session State Transfer

**The problem:** You close a chat. Open a new one. The new chat has no idea what you just spent two hours working on.

**The mechanism:** When a session ends (or the user says "prepare handoff"), the agent writes a structured summary to `.claude/handoffs/`.

```
.claude/handoffs/
  2026-04-09_14-32_373d1618.md   # session 1
  2026-04-09_15-01_b858f500.md   # session 2
  2026-04-09_16-47_ab154a15.md   # session 3
  INDEX.md                        # append-only index
```

**What a handoff contains:**

```markdown
# Session Handoff - 2026-04-09 14:32

## Goal
Fix drift validator false positives on template paths

## Done
- Updated validate_config.py: skip patterns for {{placeholder}} paths
- Added multi-strategy resolution: absolute -> relative -> cwd -> workspace

## Did NOT work (and why)
- Tried regex-only filtering: too many false negatives on real paths
- Path.exists() alone: fails on paths relative to other files

## Current state
- Working: validator catches real drift, skips templates
- Broken: nothing
- Blocked: nothing

## Next step
Run validator against 3 other projects to confirm false positive rate
```

**The critical section is "Did NOT work."** Without it, the next session will repeat the same dead ends. This is the highest-value section of any handoff - it prevents the most expensive kind of wasted work.

**Why not a single file?** Multiple Claude Code sessions can run in parallel on the same project. A single `HANDOFF.md` means the last writer wins - all other sessions' context is lost. The multi-file format with unique filenames (timestamp + session ID) is collision-free.

**Compression ratio:** A 2-hour session produces ~100K tokens of conversation. The handoff is ~1,500 tokens. That is 67x compression with higher signal density.

### Handoff as Verification Contract

A good handoff is not a dump of "what I did." It is a **contract for the next session** - with explicit verification items.

```markdown
## Verification (Phase 1, read-only, ~30 min)

1. [ ] Run `python scripts/validate_config.py` - should report 0 broken refs
2. [ ] Check `scripts/context_degradation.py --days 7` runs without errors
3. [ ] Verify HOW-IT-WORKS.md renders on GitHub (no broken links)
4. [ ] Confirm principles/README.md lists all principles (count matches directory)
5. [ ] Grep HOW-IT-WORKS.md for personal data (IPs, server names)
6. [ ] Spot-check 3 random links in README.md - do they resolve?
```

This is the [Proof Loop](principles/02-proof-loop.md) pattern applied to session transitions. The previous session does not ask the next one to trust its claims. It says: "here are 6 things to independently verify." The receiving session's role is **verifier**, not generator - it checks before it builds.

**Why this matters:** Without verification items, the next session assumes everything is correct and builds on top. If the previous session left a subtle error (a broken link, a wrong count, a leaked personal detail), it compounds. With a verification contract, the first 30 minutes are a read-only audit. Errors are caught before they propagate.

**The pattern:**
- **Generator session** = did the work, wrote the handoff, listed what to verify
- **Verifier session** = fresh context, no attachment to the work, runs the checklist
- **Separation** = the generator cannot verify itself (same bias as Generator-Evaluator)

---

## Hooks: Code That Runs When Rules Would Be Forgotten

**The problem:** A rule in the prompt says "validate file references before starting work." After 20 minutes and 50 tool calls, the agent has forgotten this rule. Context pressure pushes it out.

**The insight:** Rules are prompts for a non-deterministic mechanism. Hooks are code.

**The mechanism:** Claude Code hooks are Python scripts triggered by events:

| Event | When It Fires | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | New session opens | Validate config references |
| `PreToolUse` | Before any tool call | Block `rm -rf /`, catch secrets |
| `Stop` | Session about to close | Remind to write handoff |

**Real example - the drift validator hook:**

```python
# hooks/session-drift-validator.py (simplified)
# Event: SessionStart

import re, os, sys

def find_file_references(text):
    """Extract paths that look like real file references."""
    patterns = [
        r'(?:/[\w.-]+){2,}',           # /absolute/paths
        r'~/[\w./-]+',                  # ~/home paths
        r'[\w.-]+/[\w.-]+/[\w.-]+',     # multi-segment relative
    ]
    refs = set()
    for p in patterns:
        refs.update(re.findall(p, text))
    return refs

def validate(config_path):
    text = open(config_path).read()
    refs = find_file_references(text)
    missing = [r for r in refs if not os.path.exists(r)]
    if missing:
        print(f"[drift] {len(missing)} broken references:")
        for m in missing:
            print(f"  - {m}")

# Runs automatically at every session start
validate("CLAUDE.md")
for rule in glob(".claude/rules/*.md"):
    validate(rule)
```

**What happens when the hook fires:**
1. Agent starts a new session
2. Claude Code runs `session-drift-validator.py` before the agent sees any user input
3. If broken references are found, the output appears in the agent's context
4. Agent knows about drift *before* it acts on stale information

**The hierarchy:**
- **Hook** = shell process. Runs every time, no exceptions. Cannot be "creatively interpreted."
- **Rule** = text in a prompt. Works when the model remembers and chooses to follow it.
- **Hope** = nothing. The default state of most CLAUDE.md files.

If something must happen with certainty, it must be a hook.

**Real example - destructive command guard:**

```python
# hooks/destructive-command-guard.py
# Event: PreToolUse (Bash)

BLOCKED = [
    r'rm\s+-rf\s+/',
    r'git\s+push\s+--force',
    r'DROP\s+TABLE',
    r'git\s+reset\s+--hard',
]

def check(command):
    for pattern in BLOCKED:
        if re.search(pattern, command, re.IGNORECASE):
            return {"decision": "block",
                    "reason": f"Blocked: matches '{pattern}'"}
    return {"decision": "allow"}
```

This hook intercepts every Bash command *before execution*. The agent never gets a chance to "decide" whether the rule applies.

## KV-Cache: Why Prompt Structure Matters More Than Prompt Content

**The problem:** Claude API charges ~$15/M for fresh input tokens but ~$1.50/M for cached tokens. A 10x price difference. In a tool-heavy session with 1000+ turns, this is the difference between $100 and $1,000.

**The mechanism:** Claude's KV-cache stores computed attention states for token sequences. If a subsequent request starts with the same token prefix, those computations are reused.

**What kills the cache:**

```
BAD: Every request starts differently
  Turn 1: "Current time: 14:32:05. You are Claude..."
  Turn 2: "Current time: 14:32:47. You are Claude..."
  -> Cache miss on every turn (timestamp changed the prefix)

GOOD: Stable prefix
  Turn 1: "You are Claude... [stable rules] ... Current time: 14:32:05"
  Turn 2: "You are Claude... [stable rules] ... Current time: 14:32:47"
  -> Cache hit on everything before the timestamp
```

**Four rules for cache-friendly context:**

1. **Stable prefixes.** CLAUDE.md, rules, tool definitions - put them first. Timestamps, session-specific data - at the end.
2. **Define all tools once.** Adding or removing tools between turns rewrites the prefix. Define all tools upfront, mask unavailable ones.
3. **Results go to files, not context.** A 10,000-token tool output in context bloats every subsequent turn. Write to a file, put a pointer in context.
4. **Keep errors in context.** Failed attempts cost ~5% extra tokens but save ~40% retry cycles. The model learns from its own mistakes within a session.

**Our measurement:**

```
96.9% KV-cache hit rate across 83 sessions (7 days)
$10,929 actual cost
$78,160 cost without caching
$67,231 saved (86%)
```

## Context Fill: Does Quality Degrade at 40%?

A common claim: "40%+ context fill leads to quality degradation." We measured this.

**Setup:** 169 sessions, 45,501 turns, 1M context window, 14-day window.

**Results:**

| Fill Level | Turns | Avg Output | Tool Use% | End Turn% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0-20% | 23,373 | 246 | 89.0% | 11.0% |
| 20-40% | 14,745 | 246 | 87.0% | 13.0% |
| 40-60% | 5,926 | 284 | 86.1% | 13.9% |
| 60-80% | 1,457 | 305 | 89.1% | 10.9% |

**Interpretation:**
- Output length *increases* at higher fill levels (longer sessions = more complex tasks)
- Tool use stays stable (86-89%) across all fill levels
- End turn% shows no clear upward trend
- No evidence of degradation up to 72% fill on 1M context

**What the research says:**

- **"Lost in the Middle"** ([Liu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)): 30%+ accuracy drop when relevant info is in positions 5-15 of 20 documents. This is a *positional* effect (middle suffers most), not a fill-level effect.
- **"Context Rot"** ([Chroma Research, 2025](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)): Tested 18 frontier models. A 200K-window model degrades measurably at ~50K tokens (25% fill). Models become "unreliable around 130K" (~65% fill). No clean "40% threshold" - degradation is gradual and model-specific.
- **Manus blog** ([manus.im](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)): Focuses on cache hit rate as cost metric, not quality threshold. No "40%" number.

**Our caveats:**
- This is Claude Opus 4.6 with 1M context. On a 200K model, 40% = 80K tokens - closer to where Chroma saw degradation.
- Our proxy metrics (output length, tool use ratio) are imperfect. A model could write longer but worse responses.
- Sessions that hit 60%+ fill are rare (19 of 169), so upper buckets have less statistical power.
- Context Rot research found degradation is task-dependent: simple retrieval holds up better than complex reasoning.

**Verdict:** The "40% = degradation" claim is an oversimplification. Degradation is real but gradual, positional (middle suffers most), and highly task-dependent. On 1M context with Opus 4.6, our proxy metrics show no degradation up to 72% fill. On smaller windows, watch for quality changes earlier.

## Chronicles: Strategic History for Long-Running Projects

**The problem:** After 20 handoffs over 3 weeks, you know what to do *next* but not *why the project is in its current state*.

**The mechanism:** One markdown file per project in `.claude/chronicles/`. Each entry is 3-7 lines of strategic digest - not a handoff copy.

```markdown
# Chronicle: color-checker

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Started:** 2026-03-25

## Timeline

### 2026-03-25 - Started with LUT-based approach
Tried 3D LUT interpolation for color transfer between photos.
- Decision: LUT approach can not handle non-linear color relationships
- Pivot: switching to neural approach (lightweight CNN)

### 2026-04-02 - CNN training reached target
Trained 127K-param CNN, median deltaE 1.99 (target was <2.5).
- Decision: BK-SDM-Tiny for diffusion, separate CNN for fast inference
- Dead end: ViT-based approach too heavy for 2GB VRAM constraint

### 2026-04-11 - Optimal Transport baseline
Added OT-based method as a fast baseline (no training needed).
- Finding: OT works well for global correction, CNN better for local
- Next: hybrid approach - OT for global, CNN for local refinement
```

**How it connects to handoffs:**
- Handoff = "what's next" (tactical, session-scoped, 1-2 days)
- Chronicle = "how we got here" (strategic, project-scoped, weeks/months)
- When writing a handoff for a long-running project, also append a condensed entry to the chronicle

## Skills: Knowledge Bundles with Trigger Descriptions

**The problem:** The agent has access to general knowledge but not domain expertise. It does not know your specific deployment quirks, your model training recipes, your code review standards.

**The mechanism:** Each skill is a markdown file in `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` with an optional `references/` folder for supporting material.

**The key insight:** The skill description is a **trigger for the model**, not documentation for humans.

```
BAD:  "Helps with servers."
GOOD: "Use when: ComfyUI hangs, GPU health check needed,
       SSH tunnel not connecting, VRAM out of memory."
```

The model reads all skill descriptions and decides which ones to load based on the current task. A vague description means the skill never gets activated. A specific one with trigger phrases means the model loads it exactly when needed.

**Structure of a good skill:**

```
skills/ai-ml/flux2-lora-training/
  SKILL.md           # Core knowledge (<5000 words)
    ## When to Use   # Trigger phrases
    ## The Process   # Step-by-step
    ## Gotchas       # Real failures (mandatory)
    ## Troubleshooting  # Symptom -> cause -> fix
  references/
    dataset-prep.md  # Detailed reference material
    config-guide.md  # Loaded only when needed
  scripts/
    validate.py      # Deterministic checks
```

**DBS Framework for creating skills from research:**
- **Direction** (-> SKILL.md): decision logic, step-by-step processes, error handling
- **Blueprints** (-> references/): templates, taxonomies, static reference data
- **Solutions** (-> scripts/): deterministic code that should not go through the LLM

## Inter-Agent Mail: Directed Messaging Between Sessions

**The problem:** Handoffs (append-only shared state) and locks (exclusive resource claim) from the previous section don't cover one important case - addressing a specific other session. "Hey session beta, the benchmark you queued is ready to validate" is a targeted request, not a broadcast, not a resource claim. Without a mechanism for it, agents route targeted asks through the human, which defeats the point of autonomy.

**The mechanism:** file-based mailbox with email-style semantics. One directory per recipient; messages are markdown files with frontmatter (from, to, subject, message_id, in_reply_to, date, priority, status).

```
.claude/mailbox/
├── alpha/
│   ├── inbox/      # messages addressed to alpha
│   ├── sent/       # copies of what alpha sent (audit trail)
│   └── archive/    # processed messages
├── beta/
│   └── (same structure)
└── all/            # broadcast inbox (everyone reads)
```

**Write semantics:**
1. Sender writes the message to `mailbox/<recipient>/inbox/<message_id>.md` (atomic, one Write call)
2. Sender writes the **same file** to `mailbox/<sender>/sent/<message_id>.md` (audit copy)
3. Optionally: append a one-line entry to `mailbox/INDEX.md` for a human-readable traffic log

**Read semantics:**
Three hooks keep recipients aware without polling:
- `SessionStart` - full inbox scan at chat open, show all unread
- `UserPromptSubmit` - quick check before each user message
- `PreToolUse` (throttled, every 2 min) - catches messages that arrive mid-autonomous work

When the agent reads a message, it Edit-updates the file's `status: unread → read`. After acting, `archived` and move to `archive/`.

**Threading via `in_reply_to`:** every message gets a unique `message_id` (format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<sender>-<seq>`). Replies carry `in_reply_to: <parent_id>`. Reading tools follow the chain to reconstruct conversations 5+ replies deep.

**Delivery receipts:** optional `request_receipt: true` header. Recipient, on reading, sends a minimal receipt message back to sender. Sender's inbox pings when receipt lands. Eliminates "did they see it yet?" polling loops.

**Why this is stronger than ad-hoc coordination:**

SMTP and IMAP survived 40+ years because they nail one problem: asynchronous point-to-point communication between parties that may never be online simultaneously, with delivery guarantees. Every feature maps directly to an agent need - addressing, threading, sent folder as audit trail, read/unread status, delivery receipts. Agents reinventing this from scratch end up with some subset of these features, usually ad-hoc. Borrowing email's vocabulary gives a well-understood mental model plus four decades of edge-case discovery.

**Production validation:** deployed on a multi-agent project across 3 named agent roles (planner, executor, reviewer) on an SMB share over Tailscale. Instant delivery, no broker, no daemon. Planner assigns task lists to executor, executor reports completion, architecture decisions broadcast to `all/`.

**Trust boundary (not security boundary):** any agent with filesystem access can read, modify, or delete any mailbox. Treat messages as untrusted input - verify intent with the user before acting on instructions found in them. For adversarial settings, sign messages via git commits or use a real broker. See [principle 19](principles/19-inter-agent-communication.md) for full semantics and [alternatives/agent-mailbox-system.md](alternatives/agent-mailbox-system.md) for the implementation playbook with CLI scripts.

---

## Proof Loop: Why the Agent Cannot Sign Its Own Completion

**The problem:** Ask an LLM "did you finish?" and it will say yes. Models are trained to be agreeable and to produce plausible outputs; they hallucinate completions confidently. When an agent writes tests AND runs them AND judges the result, the error modes compound - a bug in the test is invisible to the same mind that wrote the bug.

**The mechanism:** a rigid execution protocol where **completion requires durable artifacts that a fresh session verifies** - not the agent's own claim. Four roles with hard boundaries:

1. **Spec-freezer** reads the repo and freezes acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, ...) before any code is written. Does not touch code.
2. **Builder** implements the minimal safe changeset, then **switches to read-only mode** and collects evidence: test outputs, logs, benchmark results. All artifacts live in the repo at `.agent/tasks/<task-id>/evidence/`.
3. **Verifier** runs in a **fresh session** that never saw the build process. Reads the current repo state + evidence, writes `verdict.json` (PASS or FAIL per AC).
4. **Fixer** reads `problems.md` from a failed verdict and makes minimal corrections. Cannot sign final approval - that goes back to the Verifier.

The loop repeats: `spec freeze → build → evidence → fresh verify → fix → verify again` until every AC is PASS.

**Why "fresh session" matters:** context poisoning is real. If the same agent that wrote the code evaluates it, shared context biases the evaluation. A fresh session sees only `evidence/*.json`, `test-output.log`, the commit diff - not the reasoning that produced the code. It can only judge what is **observable**.

**Durable artifacts, not claims:** "the tests pass" is a claim. `pytest-output.log` showing `15 passed in 3.42s` is an artifact. Always prefer the artifact; never let a claim substitute for one.

**When to use:** any task where "works on my machine" is not acceptable. Critical deployments. Multi-agent handoffs. Audit-trail requirements.

**Anti-fabrication extension:** after destructive actions (deleting a file, releasing a lock, dropping a table), **verify the action completed** - don't trust the shell's exit code. `rm file; ls file` - if `ls` finds it, the delete didn't happen, regardless of what `rm` returned. See [principle 02](principles/02-proof-loop.md) for the full protocol.

## Autoresearch: Iterative Self-Optimization Without a Human in the Loop

**The problem:** You have an artifact with a measurable score - a prompt with a pass rate, a SQL query with a latency, a bundle with a byte count. You want to improve it. The classical approach is "think hard, edit, re-test." This is slow, subjective, and does not compose with automation.

**The mechanism:** a mechanical loop that treats optimization as a search problem.

```
1. READ   - load the current artifact + its score
2. CHANGE - mutate exactly one thing (single-variable experiment)
3. TEST   - run the evaluation script, get a new score
4. DECIDE - keep if better, discard (git revert) if worse
5. REPEAT - until convergence or budget exhausted
```

Three conditions must hold for this to work:
1. **Numerical scoring** - subjective "better" is not computable. Convert to a number.
2. **Automated evaluation** - a human in the loop defeats the point.
3. **Single-file mutation** - one artifact changes at a time, so causality is unambiguous.

**Git as memory:** every experiment is a commit (`experiment: X → Y, score 0.82 → 0.87`). Successful experiments stay; failed ones get `git revert`. The commit log becomes the optimization history.

**Guard mechanism:** two checks per iteration:
- **Verify** - did the target metric actually improve?
- **Guard** - did nothing else break? (re-run the full test suite, check no regression elsewhere)

**3-6 binary assertions in the guard:** fewer than 3 and the agent finds loopholes (optimize the metric by breaking something uncaught); more than 6 and the agent games the checklist instead of genuinely improving.

**CORAL heartbeat for stagnation:** if 5 consecutive iterations don't improve the score, the protocol **forces a strategy pivot** instead of grinding. The agent writes what it learned, reassesses the mutation space, tries a different direction. Without this, autoresearch degenerates into infinite local-minimum thrashing.

**HyperAgent upgrade path:** for bigger budgets, replace the linear loop with a **version graph** - branch experiments in parallel, later `select_next_parent` to continue from the best branch. Execution infrastructure for this: Contree microVMs give immutable `result_image` UUIDs as version graph nodes, `disposable=false` saves branches, parallel `wait=false` calls explore 3-5 mutations simultaneously.

**Cost at typical scale:** ~$0.10 per iteration. $5-25 per overnight run (50-100 experiments). Cheap enough to let it run on any artifact with a scriptable score. See [principle 03](principles/03-autoresearch.md) for the full protocol.

## Documentation Integrity: Catching Drift Before the Agent Acts on It

**The problem:** CLAUDE.md says "run `foo.py` for the benchmark." A month later, `foo.py` was renamed to `benchmark.py`. The agent reads CLAUDE.md, tries to run `foo.py`, fails. Or worse - guesses confidently based on the now-stale reference. This failure mode compounds: for a human, "oh right, it's `benchmark.py` now" is a two-second correction; for an agent following stale docs as ground truth, it's a confidently wrong execution.

**The mechanism:** a SessionStart hook that validates every file reference in config before the agent reads them.

```
Session starts
  ↓
Hook: scripts/validate_config.py runs
  ↓
Scan CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/*.md for file paths
  ↓
For each path: does it exist? (multi-strategy lookup)
  ↓
Print drift report to stdout
  ↓
Harness injects report into agent context
  ↓
Agent now knows which references are stale BEFORE acting on them
```

**Multi-strategy path resolution:** the script distinguishes real paths (absolute, `~/`, multi-segment like `scripts/validate_config.py`) from conceptual mentions (a bare `foo.py` in prose). For real paths, it tries resolution against: the file's own directory → relative to cwd → known workspace roots. This avoids false positives on illustrative mentions while catching actual stale pointers.

**Rule vs Hook distinction - important:**
- **Rule:** instruction in markdown, lives in the system prompt. The agent "should" follow it. Under context pressure it may be forgotten.
- **Hook:** shell process triggered on an event. Runs **every time**, no exceptions.

If you need a guarantee that X happens when Y occurs, it has to be a hook. Rules are hopes; hooks are executions. Documentation validation is too important to leave to hope, so it is a hook.

**Why at session start, not after failure:** the Rust analogy applies. Memory errors can be caught at runtime (crash + fix + retry) or at compile time (program won't build). The session start check is the compile-time version - drift is detected **before** the agent commits to an action based on stale info. Post-hoc detection would already mean the agent burned tokens and confused its own reasoning.

**Ships working:** `scripts/validate_config.py` + `hooks/session-drift-validator.py`. Drop both into a project, wire the hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`, and drift reports start appearing automatically. See [principle 11](principles/11-documentation-integrity.md) for setup.

## Supply Chain Defense: One Line That Blocked a Nation-State Attack

**The mechanism:** One configuration line:

```ini
# ~/.npmrc
min-release-age=7
```

Packages published less than 7 days ago are not installed. Period.

**Why this works:** Most malicious packages are detected within 1-3 days. The 7-day delay lets the security community catch them before they reach your machine.

**Real incident:** On March 31, 2026, DPRK-linked group Sapphire Sleet compromised the official `axios` npm package (~100M weekly downloads). They published versions 1.14.1 and 0.30.4 with a backdoor. The exposure window was 3 hours (00:21-03:29 UTC).

`min-release-age=7` would have blocked both versions completely. The attack was detected within hours, but anyone who installed during that 3-hour window was compromised.

**For Python (uv):**

```toml
# ~/.config/uv/uv.toml

## Multi-Session Coordination: When Parallel Chats Share a Workspace

**The problem:** You open two Claude Code chats in the same project. Chat 1 starts training a model on GPU 2. Chat 2, not knowing, starts its own training on GPU 2. One crashes with an out-of-memory error. Or worse: both save their handoff to `.claude/HANDOFF.md` and the later one silently wipes the earlier one.

**The mechanism:** Two different kinds of shared state need two different mechanisms, and mixing them loses data.

**Type 1 - Append-only (handoffs, logs, findings):** each session writes its own file with a unique name. No session ever reads-then-writes another session's file. Conflict-free by construction.
```
.claude/handoffs/
  2026-04-09_14-32_373d1618.md    # chat 1
  2026-04-09_15-01_b858f500.md    # chat 2
  INDEX.md                         # append-only log of who wrote what
```

**Type 2 - Mutable (GPU/port/container ownership):** exactly one session can hold the resource. Others must see "taken" and back off. Uses a lock file per resource with a heartbeat timestamp.
```
.claude/locks/
  gpu_host-a_3.lock    # session_id, task, started, heartbeat
```

**Why not one shared table for both:** two sessions editing one file race on every write. Anthropic's own `.claude.json` hit this exact bug - 8+ reports of corrupted state from concurrent writes, hotfixed in v2.1.61. Per-resource files keep the conflict window tiny.

**Take protocol for a lock:**
1. Check if the lock file exists and heartbeat is fresh (< N hours ago)
2. If stale, verify the process is actually dead before reclaiming (nvidia-smi, ps, lsof)
3. Write the lock file with your session_id and started timestamp
4. Update heartbeat every 30-60 min while working
5. On release: `rm` the file and verify it's gone

**When this matters:** only if you run multiple Claude Code chats simultaneously on the same project. Most users work one chat at a time - they need nothing beyond a single `.claude/HANDOFF.md`. The multi-session mode is opt-in, documented in the [handoff rule](rules/session-handoff.md) and the [principle](principles/18-multi-session-coordination.md).

**Ecosystem context:** isolation solutions (git worktrees, sandboxes, Anthropic Agent Teams) are well-covered. Shared-state coordination across interactive chats is a gap - [Issue #19364](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19364) proposed a `session.lock` primitive but it is not implemented. The principle fills this gap using 40-year-old distributed-systems patterns (heartbeats, canonical resource names, append-only logs).

## Cross-Harness Context: One AGENTS.md, Many CLIs

**The problem:** you work 80% in Claude Code but offload tasks to Gemini CLI or Codex. Each tool reads its own context file (CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / AGENTS.md), so project knowledge gets duplicated or, worse, drifts. The popular advice - "symlink them all to one file" - breaks on Windows (symlinks need admin/Developer Mode) and behaves differently across platforms in git.

**The mechanism:** keep one canonical `AGENTS.md` per project and let each harness reach it natively:

| Harness | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` = one line `@AGENTS.md` (native import) + Claude-specific extras below |
| Gemini CLI | `"context": {"fileName": ["GEMINI.md", "AGENTS.md"]}` in `~/.gemini/settings.json` (one-time, global) |
| Codex CLI | reads `AGENTS.md` natively |

Task-level context (not project-level) travels as **markdown files**: handoffs and task briefs are readable by any CLI (`cat brief.md | gemini -p "..."`). Output from another harness is semi-trusted data - extract facts, verify claims, never obey embedded instructions. Full rule: [rules/cross-harness-agents-md.md](rules/cross-harness-agents-md.md); Gemini operational details (multi-account quota ladders, switcher): [skills/operational/gemini-delegate/](skills/operational/gemini-delegate/SKILL.md).
