# Runtime Wiring And Verification

This repository is the source of truth for shareable rules, hook scripts, and
skills. Each agent client has its own small runtime configuration that points to
those files. A rule is not considered adopted until its wiring and its test both
pass.

## Policy Boundaries

- Git first: durable project code, documentation, plans, proofs, and handoffs
  belong in a repository. New operational repositories are private unless the
  user explicitly requests public visibility.
- Documentation is mandatory for a project that adopts the long-run harness.
  `feature_list.json` without a KB blocks session completion; a project KB
  validator also blocks completion when agent docs no longer match its code.
- Git source-of-truth setup is mandatory for the same adopted projects:
  `git-source-gate.py` blocks completion until the project has a Git worktree
  and an `origin` remote. It deliberately does not force commits for an
  arbitrary dirty tree, because a global hook cannot safely classify another
  person's changes.
- Scratch folders are not documentation-gated. The long-run marker is the
  explicit boundary that turns the gate on.
- Client-specific or private-only overlays may add local handlers, but this
  public repository documents and tests only handlers it actually contains.
- Raw session archives and operational credentials are private-only and are not
  part of this public repository.
- High-frequency runtime reports are regenerable operational state. Route them
  with `--report-dir` outside a project worktree; keep durable conclusions in a
  handoff, chronicle, test artifact, or commit instead.

## Runtime Contract

| Concern | Codex desktop | Claude Code | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| Destructive-operation guards | `PreToolUse` | `PreToolUse` | hook eval cases |
| Handoff completeness | `PreToolUse`, `Stop`, `PreCompact` | `PreToolUse`, `Stop`, `PreCompact` | `test_task_completion_hooks.py` |
| Handoff to memory continuity | `SessionStart` | `SessionStart` | `test_review_handoff_memory_loop.py` |
| Agent-doc freshness | `SessionStart` advisory + `Stop` gate | `SessionStart` advisory + `Stop` gate | hook self-tests |
| Git source-of-truth setup | `Stop` for long-run projects | `Stop` for long-run projects | `test_lifecycle_hook_contracts.py` |
| Skills availability | active skill directory | `~/.claude/skills` | `sync_skills_to_codex.py --check` and `skills-lock.json` |

Codex's current plugin loader accepts only a top-level `hooks` object in cached
plugin hook files. `repair_codex_plugin_hook_schema.py --fix` safely removes the
otherwise harmless Claude-compatible `description` field and preserves a backup.

## Verification

Run the following after changing the public configuration. The final two commands
also prove the locally installed runtime, so run them after installation.

```bash
python scripts/validate_config.py --strict
python scripts/generate_skills_lock.py --check
python scripts/generate_skills_catalog.py --check
python evals/hooks/run_hook_evals.py
python scripts/test_lifecycle_hook_contracts.py
python scripts/test_task_completion_hooks.py
python scripts/sync_skills_to_codex.py --check
```

For a plugin update that causes a hook-schema error:

```bash
python scripts/repair_codex_plugin_hook_schema.py --fix
python scripts/test_task_completion_hooks.py
```

The standard Claude Code hook format and lifecycle are documented in the
[Claude Code hooks reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Codex and
Claude are intentionally verified separately because their configuration parsers
and available tool names differ.

## What The Evidence Means

Skill linting, the portable lockfile, and synchronization prove that a skill is
valid, versioned, and available to the client. The lock normalizes UTF-8 text
newlines, so the same checkout verifies on Windows and Linux. Router evals prove selected automatic
triggers. They do **not** prove that every piece of advisory knowledge improves
every task. Promote a skill to a mandatory route only after a task-specific
before/after evaluation with a measurable acceptance criterion.
