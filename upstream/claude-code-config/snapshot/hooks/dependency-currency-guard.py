"""PreToolUse: check dependencies against the registry before they enter a manifest.

Package names and versions are where writing from memory fails first and most
quietly. A hallucinated package name looks exactly like a real one until install
time; a version recalled from training data is silently years old; and our own
supply-chain rule (`min-release-age=7` in ~/.npmrc and uv.toml) is policy that
nothing has ever enforced at the moment a dependency is actually added.

So this asks the registry, at the one moment the answer matters:

  * package does not exist         -> BLOCK. The hallucinated-dependency failure,
                                     and how typosquats land.
  * name registered recently       -> BLOCK. Existence is not authenticity. In a
                                     slopsquat the package DOES exist -- someone
                                     registered the hallucination on purpose. A
                                     model cannot remember a name younger than
                                     its training data, so confidence about one
                                     is the signature of the attack, not of use.
  * almost nobody installs it      -> BLOCK. A real dependency proposed with
                                     confidence has users; a lure does not.
  * published less than 7 days ago -> BLOCK. Our stated supply-chain buffer,
                                     finally mechanical instead of aspirational.
  * fast-moving package pinned far
    behind (torch, transformers,
    numpy and friends)             -> BLOCK. Not a security failure but a silent
                                     one: an old CUDA-tagged pin installs, runs,
                                     and quietly costs the wrong kernels.
  * anything else behind           -> report the current version, do not block.
                                     Old is often deliberate; unknown never is.

Fail-open by design: no network, a slow registry or an unparsable manifest must
never wedge an edit. A guard that blocks when the internet hiccups gets disabled,
and a disabled guard protects nothing.

Bypass: `# claude-bypass: deps` in the content, or CLAUDE_SKIP_DEP_CHECK=1.
