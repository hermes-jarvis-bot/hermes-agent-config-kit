"""PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit): advisory nudge on large / dependency-adding code changes.

Makes the quality-code / anti-over-engineering (YAGNI) principle a PERMANENT
MECHANICAL layer, not just an always-on rule that decays under context pressure.

Design (research-backed 2026-06-16):
  * NON-BLOCKING by construction. It emits an advisory only — it NEVER blocks, so
    it cannot cause under-delivery or fight the finish-the-task / completeness canon
    (a legitimately large *complete* feature must never be gated). A hard lint-gate
    was explicitly rejected for this reason.
  * Checks ONLY reliable mechanical signals: a large net addition to a code file,
    or a new dependency in a manifest. Fuzzy "abstraction smells" (factory-for-one,
    interface-with-one-impl, speculative config) are deliberately NOT auto-classified
    here — they need semantic judgment; left to the model + the /lean-code (or /simplify) review skill.
  * Scoped to code files + dependency manifests. Docs/markdown/data are skipped
    (consolidating a big doc is not over-engineering).

Evidence: AI agents measurably over-produce code (GitClear 211M-line study, 2025);
always-on minimalism is non-monotonic so enforcement must advise, not gate
(arXiv 2601.22025). The 80-94% marketing numbers are unverified; the durable,
evaluable win is "smallest solution that FULLY satisfies the task".

Tunables: CLAUDE_BLOAT_EDIT_LINES (default 150), CLAUDE_BLOAT_NEWFILE_LINES (300).
Bypass: CLAUDE_ALLOW_BLOAT=1 or a `# claude-bypass: bloat` marker in the content.
