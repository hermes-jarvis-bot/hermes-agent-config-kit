# Cross-Harness Continuation

Use this skill when a task continues after another agent, especially when the
handoff is Claude -> Codex, Codex -> Claude, or a plugin has already received
several partial fixes.

## Operating contract

The repository is the source of truth for code. The continuation contract is
the source of truth for intent that Git cannot express:

`<repo>/.claude/continuity/CONTINUITY.json`

The canonical shape is in `references/CONTINUITY.example.json`. It must contain:

- `mode`: `continuation` for incremental work, `new` for greenfield work;
- `baseline`: branch, commit, and paths that were already dirty at handoff;
- `scope.files`: the files explicitly claimed for the current slice;
- `preserve`: accepted design decisions and invariants;
- `do_not_redo`: approaches already tested or deliberately rejected;
- `verification`: commands and evidence status;
- `scope.enforce` and `scope.protect_unlisted` when the slice must be strict.

## Required sequence

1. Read `CONTINUITY.json`, the newest handoff, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, and
   the current Git status. Treat the live checkout as authoritative over stale
   prose.
2. Verify the baseline commit, branch, dirty paths, and the claimed files.
   Preserve existing changes unless a test or the contract proves they are
   wrong.
3. Make one focused continuation change. Use `Edit` for existing files. Do not
   replace a whole file merely because another implementation is easier to
   write.
4. Run the smallest relevant test, then the independent verifier for a
   non-trivial or cross-module change. Record commands and outcomes in the
   contract or handoff.
5. Update the contract with what was preserved, what changed, what failed, and
   the single next step. Commit a clean, descriptive checkpoint when the
   project workflow allows it.

## Replan boundary

Replanning is valid when measured evidence shows the current design is wrong,
the requirements changed, or an explicit user decision authorizes a redesign.
Declare it in the process that launches the agent:

```text
AGENT_CONTINUITY_MODE=replan
AGENT_CONTINUITY_REASON=<specific evidence and intended redesign>
```

The reason is required. Without it, the guard blocks whole-file overwrites,
out-of-scope edits, and near-whole-file replacements. A replan must also be
recorded in the decision log/handoff; an environment flag alone is not proof.

## Plugin cleanup

Do not revert a plugin because its code “looks different”. First classify the
diff as intentional, unverified, or conflicting; reconstruct the baseline from
Git; run the plugin's focused tests and a fresh read-only verifier; then repair
only confirmed regressions. Keep the old implementation available through Git
or an isolated worktree until the replacement passes its acceptance checks.

## Gotchas

- A handoff without baseline and changed-file facts is context, not a merge
  contract. Do not infer scope from prose alone.
- A clean Git tree does not prove semantic compatibility. Run the focused test
  and inspect the dependency boundary before declaring continuation complete.
- Parallel agents need isolated worktrees and an integration verifier; this
  skill protects serial handoff and cannot resolve a concurrent merge for you.
- `CONTINUITY.json` is intentionally small. Put long research and transcripts
  in the private archive or project docs and link them from the contract.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No CONTINUITY.json found` | The prior session left only prose handoff | Create the contract from the current Git baseline before editing existing code |
| `scope violation` | The task expanded beyond the claimed slice | Finish the slice or update scope with a recorded reason |
| `blocks Write over existing tracked file` | Whole-file overwrite would erase prior intent | Use a focused `Edit`, or explicitly enter replan mode |
| `near-whole-file replacement` | An edit is acting like a rewrite | Split the edit and test each step, or replan with evidence |
| Claude and Codex disagree | No shared decision/evidence was recorded | Re-read `preserve`, `do_not_redo`, tests, and Git; do not “pick a side” by intuition |
